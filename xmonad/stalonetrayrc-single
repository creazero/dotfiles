# This stalonetrayrc is meant to match with xmobar-single.hs. If you use both,
# then you'll get a perfect setup on a single 4k display (3840x2160). If you
# have dual monitors, see stalonetrayrc-dual and xmobar-dual.hs.

# If you're using a single display with a different resolution, adjust the
# geometry below using the given calculation.

# 1 row of 12 icons, each 23px wide/tall. Resolution 3840x2160.
# This icon size aligns with the size of xmobar with font "xft:monospace-8"
# position = display_width - (num_icons * icon_size)
# position = 3840 - (12 * 23) = 3564
# Example: geometry 12x1+3564
geometry 5x1+1805
