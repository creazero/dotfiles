-- This xmobar config is for a single 4k display (3840x2160) and meant to be
-- used with the stalonetrayrc-single config.
--
-- If you're using a single display with a different resolution, adjust the
-- position argument below using the given calculation.
Config {
    -- Position xmobar along the top, with a stalonetray in the top right.
    -- Add right padding to xmobar to ensure stalonetray and xmobar don't
    -- overlap. stalonetrayrc-single is configured for 12 icons, each 23px
    -- wide. 
    -- right_padding = num_icons * icon_size
    -- right_padding = 12 * 23 = 276
