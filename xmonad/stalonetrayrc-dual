# This stalonetrayrc is meant to match with xmobar-dual.hs. If you use both,
# then you'll get a perfect setup on dual 2560x1440 displays, with the right
# display as primary. The primary display shows both xmobar and stalonetray.
# If you have a single display, see stalonetrayrc-single xmobar-single.hs.

# If you're using dual displays with different resolutions, adjust the
# geometry below using the given calculation.

# 1 row of 12 icons, each 23px wide/tall.
# This icon size aligns with the size of xmobar with font "xft:monospace-8"
# Resolution of each display is 2560x1440.
# Combined width of both displays is 2560 * 2 = 5120.
# position = combined_width - (num_icons * icon_size)
# position = 5120 - (12 * 23) = 4844
# Example: geometry 12x1+4844
geometry 5x1+3725
